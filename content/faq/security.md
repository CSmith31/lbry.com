We take security very seriously. Send an email to <security@lbry.com>, and we'll get back to you ASAP. Bounties will be paid in LBC for valid security reports based on information provided and severity.

Our PGP key is [here](/faq/pgp-key). You can encrypt a message to us using this [web form](https://keybase.io/encrypt#lbry).
