Applications play a tremendous role in the success of the LBRY protocol and are how almost everyone uses the LBRY network.

LBRY maintains three applications:

- [lbry-desktop](http://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) (JS/React), an Electron based desktop browser and wallet. This codebase also powers [odysee.com](https://odysee.com).
- [lbry-android](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android) (Java), a browser and wallet for Android. This codebase will also power a forthcoming Odysee Android app.
- [odysee-ios](https://github.com/lbryio/odysee-ios) (Swift), the Odysee mobile app.

Success at this position involves strength at both user-experience and programming. Application engineers are expected to play a substantial role in product vision and design. 

Being able to showcase previous experience creating delightful, engaging applications is beneficial for obtaining this position.
