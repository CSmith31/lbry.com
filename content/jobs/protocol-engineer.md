Protocol engineers are responsible for building and maintaining all the non-blockchain parts of LBRY, though they work closely with
the blockchain team and there's a lot of cross-pollination. Protocol work involves deeply technical things like networking 
(DHT, TCP, UDP), databases (key-value and SQL), filesystems. It also involves maintaining an open-source project: communicating 
clearly in writing, reviewing code contributions, and interacting with the wider LBRY community. You can be a great protocol engineer
by excelling at either half of the equation or by showing a strong ability to bridge the two halves.

Our [code](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) is currently in Python, but we're migrating to Go. 
Experience with either language, or with blockchain or peer-to-peer technology, is beneficial but not required.
