This position would be our full-time first security hire, though we've always been a security-conscious company. 
You'd be in charge of everything security-related: threat modeling and identifying vulnerabilities, 
proposing solutions (and implementing them in some cases), reviewing design decisions for security 
bugs, mitigating platform risk, running a bug bounty program, and so on. In addition, digital money presents its own set of
challenges, both in terms of designing systems that are secure and easy-to-use, and in terms of
making us juicy targets for hackers.

You'd have a lot of freedom (and therefore responsibility) to set security priorities for LBRY. Experience in the blockchain
world is a plus.
